### Color Clock

The Color Clock functions to show the current time as a hex code, and the container div reflects that color.

This assignment required more use of the DOM and use of the Javsript date constructor, providing the date and time right down to the millisecond if your heart so desire.  

We also learned to style more easily with SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), which allows for nested rules and mixins.
